What and why
Since the start of modern AI in late 2022 we've seen an extraordinary number of AI applications for accomplishing tasks. There are thousands of websites, chat-bots, mobile apps, and other interfaces for using all the different AI out there.

It's all really exciting and powerful, but it's not easy to integrate this functionality into our lives.

In other words, AI doesn't have a capabilities problem—it has an integration problem.
Fabric was created to address this by creating and organizing the fundamental units of AI—the prompts themselves!

Fabric organizes prompts by real-world task, allowing people to create, collect, and organize their most important AI solutions in a single place for use in their favorite tools. And if you're command-line focused, you can use Fabric itself as the interface!
