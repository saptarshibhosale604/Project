hey what's up my name is Daniel misler hey what's up my name is Daniel misler hey what's up my name is Daniel misler and I'm super excited to share with you and I'm super excited to share with you and I'm super excited to share with you a new AI project I've just created a new AI project I've just created a new AI project I've just created called fabric so the basic idea of called fabric so the basic idea of called fabric so the basic idea of fabric is to start with human problems fabric is to start with human problems fabric is to start with human problems ever since the beginning of ever since the beginning of ever since the beginning of 2023 we've had a million pieces of AI 2023 we've had a million pieces of AI 2023 we've had a million pieces of AI flying around we've had apps we have flying around we've had apps we have flying around we've had apps we have chat GPT we have mobile apps now we have chat GPT we have mobile apps now we have chat GPT we have mobile apps now we have voice applications and most of all we voice applications and most of all we voice applications and most of all we have a million different prompts and the have a million different prompts and the have a million different prompts and the question is how do we actually use all question is how do we actually use all question is how do we actually use all this stuff and then that's the challenge this stuff and then that's the challenge this stuff and then that's the challenge I had for myself in the beginning of I had for myself in the beginning of I had for myself in the beginning of last year so what I started doing was last year so what I started doing was last year so what I started doing was thinking from the top down from a human thinking from the top down from a human thinking from the top down from a human perspective what do I actually want to perspective what do I actually want to perspective what do I actually want to do with AI what what do I think other do with AI what what do I think other do with AI what what do I think other people should be doing with AI as well people should be doing with AI as well people should be doing with AI as well and what that did was brought me to a and what that did was brought me to a and what that did was brought me to a human focused approach to Ai and what human focused approach to Ai and what human focused approach to Ai and what that means is I'm thinking first what that means is I'm thinking first what that means is I'm thinking first what are we trying to do at a human level are we trying to do at a human level are we trying to do at a human level with technology and specifically Ai and with technology and specifically Ai and with technology and specifically Ai and how do we categorize that and sort of how do we categorize that and sort of how do we categorize that and sort of capture it so this is essentially me capture it so this is essentially me capture it so this is essentially me here I like to read I like to listen to here I like to read I like to listen to here I like to read I like to listen to things I like to watch things discuss things I like to watch things discuss things I like to watch things discuss them think these are my inputs and them think these are my inputs and them think these are my inputs and ultimately what I'm trying to do is ultimately what I'm trying to do is ultimately what I'm trying to do is become better at doing all these things become better at doing all these things become better at doing all these things but more importantly applying them into but more importantly applying them into but more importantly applying them into something that matters in my life which something that matters in my life which something that matters in my life which is making better decisions that's is making better decisions that's is making better decisions that's ultimately what I'm trying to do here at ultimately what I'm trying to do here at ultimately what I'm trying to do here at step five so consuming all this stuff at step five so consuming all this stuff at step five so consuming all this stuff at layer one gets me new ideas at Layer layer one gets me new ideas at Layer layer one gets me new ideas at Layer Two which allows me to update my model Two which allows me to update my model Two which allows me to update my model of the world at layer three which can of the world at layer three which can of the world at layer three which can update my algorithms for how I actually update my algorithms for how I actually update my algorithms for how I actually do specific tasks at layer 4 and do specific tasks at layer 4 and do specific tasks at layer 4 and ultimately result in better decision- ultimately result in better decision- ultimately result in better decision- making so this is ultimately what I'm making so this is ultimately what I'm making so this is ultimately what I'm trying to actually accomplish in my life trying to actually accomplish in my life trying to actually accomplish in my life using technology including AI so I'm using technology including AI so I'm using technology including AI so I'm starting with that as the focus the next starting with that as the focus the next starting with that as the focus the next next thing I did was start to think of next thing I did was start to think of next thing I did was start to think of everything in terms of challenges so everything in terms of challenges so everything in terms of challenges so once again we're at the human level here once again we're at the human level here once again we're at the human level here we're not doing tech for the sake of we're not doing tech for the sake of we're not doing tech for the sake of doing Tech we're not doing AI for the doing Tech we're not doing AI for the doing Tech we're not doing AI for the sake of doing AI we're thinking about sake of doing AI we're thinking about sake of doing AI we're thinking about what are we actually trying to do on a what are we actually trying to do on a what are we actually trying to do on a day-to-day basis in terms of problems day-to-day basis in terms of problems day-to-day basis in terms of problems we're trying to solve challenges we're we're trying to solve challenges we're we're trying to solve challenges we're trying to overcome and for me I've I've trying to overcome and for me I've I've trying to overcome and for me I've I've got a list here right so I don't talk to got a list here right so I don't talk to got a list here right so I don't talk to my friends enough okay let's let's say my friends enough okay let's let's say my friends enough okay let's let's say that's a problem which it is sometimes that's a problem which it is sometimes that's a problem which it is sometimes there's too much content I I don't have there's too much content I I don't have there's too much content I I don't have time to read or watch you know multiple time to read or watch you know multiple time to read or watch you know multiple super long form podcasts read super long super long form podcasts read super long super long form podcasts read super long essays especially if I can't tell right essays especially if I can't tell right essays especially if I can't tell right off the bat if they're really good or off the bat if they're really good or off the bat if they're really good or not so the these are all problems right not so the these are all problems right not so the these are all problems right even if the content is good I don't have even if the content is

of thing uh I can't watch all the bounties and the Scopes let's say I'm bounties and the Scopes let's say I'm bounties and the Scopes let's say I'm doing security testing I can't look at doing security testing I can't look at doing security testing I can't look at all the different programs I could all the different programs I could all the different programs I could possibly be testing I don't have time to possibly be testing I don't have time to possibly be testing I don't have time to go kickoff automation all the time I go kickoff automation all the time I go kickoff automation all the time I don't have to time to figure out what's don't have to time to figure out what's don't have to time to figure out what's in academic paper if someone sends me a in academic paper if someone sends me a in academic paper if someone sends me a contract do I have time to read it all contract do I have time to read it all contract do I have time to read it all the way through and look for the gotas the way through and look for the gotas the way through and look for the gotas these are all problems that I run into these are all problems that I run into these are all problems that I run into on a daily basis so I sort of think of on a daily basis so I sort of think of on a daily basis so I sort of think of those as my challenges then over here on those as my challenges then over here on those as my challenges then over here on the right I'm looking at how can I turn the right I'm looking at how can I turn the right I'm looking at how can I turn those into components right how do I those into components right how do I those into components right how do I turn those into discrete objects that I turn those into discrete objects that I turn those into discrete objects that I can then apply AI to and that brings us can then apply AI to and that brings us can then apply AI to and that brings us to the project itself which is called to the project itself which is called to the project itself which is called fabric as we talked about and it is on fabric as we talked about and it is on fabric as we talked about and it is on github.com Danel misler SL github.com Danel misler SL github.com Danel misler SL fabric got the logo here got the mission fabric got the logo here got the mission fabric got the logo here got the mission human flourishing via AI augmentation human flourishing via AI augmentation human flourishing via AI augmentation and it's an open source framework for and it's an open source framework for and it's an open source framework for augmenting humans using AI so so the augmenting humans using AI so so the augmenting humans using AI so so the first thing to talk about here is just first thing to talk about here is just first thing to talk about here is just the structure of it so the entire the structure of it so the entire the structure of it so the entire project is themed off of the concept of project is themed off of the concept of project is themed off of the concept of Fabrics or blankets or I don't know Fabrics or blankets or I don't know Fabrics or blankets or I don't know patterns that kind of thing so patterns that kind of thing so patterns that kind of thing so essentially you have the project itself essentially you have the project itself essentially you have the project itself which is called fabric the optional which is called fabric the optional which is called fabric the optional server that you could set up to run this server that you could set up to run this server that you could set up to run this thing independently yourself this is thing independently yourself this is thing independently yourself this is optional you don't have to do that but optional you don't have to do that but optional you don't have to do that but it's called a mill the patterns it's called a mill the patterns it's called a mill the patterns themselves the individual little blocks themselves the individual little blocks themselves the individual little blocks of AI that apply to specific problems of AI that apply to specific problems of AI that apply to specific problems those are called patterns and they're those are called patterns and they're those are called patterns and they're all otherwise known as prompts so you all otherwise known as prompts so you all otherwise known as prompts so you could just think of those as the prompts could just think of those as the prompts could just think of those as the prompts those are called patterns if you link those are called patterns if you link those are called patterns if you link multiple patterns together those are multiple patterns together those are multiple patterns together those are called stitches and looms are client called stitches and looms are client called stitches and looms are client side apps which you don't actually have side apps which you don't actually have side apps which you don't actually have to use anymore but they're there and to use anymore but they're there and to use anymore but they're there and they're all part of that naming they're all part of that naming they're all part of that naming structure okay going back into the top structure okay going back into the top structure okay going back into the top and navigating the files here we're and navigating the files here we're and navigating the files here we're going to go into going to go into going to go into patterns and this is where you see the patterns and this is where you see the patterns and this is where you see the core content of the project there's lots core content of the project there's lots core content of the project there's lots of stuff going on here you don't really of stuff going on here you don't really of stuff going on here you don't really need to worry about too much of it uh need to worry about too much of it uh need to worry about too much of it uh we're going to talk about installation a we're going to talk about installation a we're going to talk about installation a little bit later but this is the main little bit later but this is the main little bit later but this is the main content analyze claims this is like content analyze claims this is like content analyze claims this is like analyzing uh somebody making a claim analyzing uh somebody making a claim analyzing uh somebody making a claim online that so and so is true or so and online that so and so is true or so and online that so and so is true or so and so is not true this analyzes claims and so is not true this analyzes claims and

any of these here what you see is a system prompt and this what you see is a system prompt and this what you see is a system prompt and this system prompt is the thing that matters system prompt is the thing that matters system prompt is the thing that matters this is the content of a pattern this is this is the content of a pattern this is this is the content of a pattern this is a markdown file and this markdown file a markdown file and this markdown file a markdown file and this markdown file defines exactly what the prompt does defines exactly what the prompt does defines exactly what the prompt does what the AI what the AI what the AI does to address this specific problem so does to address this specific problem so does to address this specific problem so this one is about extracting article this one is about extracting article this one is about extracting article wisdom so this is specifically for when wisdom so this is specifically for when wisdom so this is specifically for when you have an article it's a political you have an article it's a political you have an article it's a political article it's talking about a security article it's talking about a security article it's talking about a security thing or it's just some kind of human thing or it's just some kind of human thing or it's just some kind of human story whatever it is you want to know story whatever it is you want to know story whatever it is you want to know what the main ideas are you want to know what the main ideas are you want to know what the main ideas are you want to know what the main takeaways are the things what the main takeaways are the things what the main takeaways are the things you should pay attention to and so we you should pay attention to and so we you should pay attention to and so we have an identity and purpose where we have an identity and purpose where we have an identity and purpose where we tell the AI like who it is how to think tell the AI like who it is how to think tell the AI like who it is how to think of itself and what its mission is in of itself and what its mission is in of itself and what its mission is in this particular piece of AI then we tell this particular piece of AI then we tell this particular piece of AI then we tell it the steps to follow to actually do it the steps to follow to actually do it the steps to follow to actually do the AI the AI the AI task and then we tell it exactly how to task and then we tell it exactly how to task and then we tell it exactly how to Output and then the input comes behind Output and then the input comes behind Output and then the input comes behind it and that's what you're going to send it and that's what you're going to send it and that's what you're going to send in from the in from the in from the article and that results in the output article and that results in the output article and that results in the output which we're going to talk about when we which we're going to talk about when we which we're going to talk about when we go into examples but this is an example go into examples but this is an example go into examples but this is an example of one pattern and again we've got of one pattern and again we've got of one pattern and again we've got dozens in here and we just keep adding dozens in here and we just keep adding dozens in here and we just keep adding to them so those are the patterns okay to them so those are the patterns okay to them so those are the patterns okay so one more example of a pattern before so one more example of a pattern before so one more example of a pattern before we jump into actually using it and we jump into actually using it and we jump into actually using it and showing the examples dynamically this showing the examples dynamically this showing the examples dynamically this one is called analyze pros and it does a one is called analyze pros and it does a one is called analyze pros and it does a few things it looks at the novelty of few things it looks at the novelty of few things it looks at the novelty of something it looks something it looks something it looks at going down here the clarity of the at going down here the clarity of the at going down here the clarity of the writing and it also looks at the pros in writing and it also looks at the pros in writing and it also looks

most of already happened to me I put out most of these myself in the initial launch of these myself in the initial launch of these myself in the initial launch of the project and that was a couple weeks the project and that was a couple weeks the project and that was a couple weeks ago and people have already submitted ago and people have already submitted ago and people have already submitted new patterns updated patterns their own new patterns updated patterns their own new patterns updated patterns their own versions of the patterns and guess what versions of the patterns and guess what

meaning and that book changed search for meaning and that book changed search for meaning and that book changed my life and I got it because of this AI my life and I got it because of this AI my life and I got it because of this AI because of fabric being able to pull because of fabric being able to pull because of fabric being able to pull interesting references out so anytime interesting references out so anytime interesting references out so anytime somebody in the conversation says oh somebody in the conversation says oh somebody in the conversation says oh yeah you you read that or you saw that yeah you you read that or you saw that yeah you you read that or you saw that piece of art or whatever that is piece of art or whatever that is piece of art or whatever that is something that gets mentioned here it something that gets mentioned here it something that gets mentioned here it gets gets gets extracted then finally it ends up with extracted then finally it ends up with extracted then finally it ends up with recommendations so that can go directly recommendations so that can go directly recommendations so that can go directly into you know an update for your model

command so now we're like a regular CLI command so now we're going to rate the quality of the essay going to rate the quality of the essay going to rate the quality of the essay that it wrote so I've never done this that it wrote so I've never done this that it wrote so I've never done this before we're going to see what it before we're going to see what it before we're going to see what it does okay and now we have content coming does okay and now we have content coming does okay and now we have content coming back so we got a one- sentence summary back so we got a one- sentence summary back so we got a one- sentence summary and again this thing is going to rate um and again this thing is going to rate um and again this thing is going to rate um it's going to label the content it's it's going to label the content it's it's going to label the content it's also going to rate it okay we got an A also going to rate it okay we got an A also going to rate it okay we got an A tier rating so this is based on video tier rating so this is based on video tier rating so this is based on video game ratings so s tier is like the game ratings so s tier is like the game ratings so s tier is like the absolute best a tier means that it is absolute best a tier means that it is absolute best a tier means that it is something that you should consume within something that you should consume within something that you should consume within the month because it's really really the month because it's really really the month because it's really really good and it also gives the reasons why good and it also gives the reasons why good and it also gives the reasons why it's rating these things at this level it's rating these things at this level it's rating these things at this level and then it actually gives us a score a and then it actually gives us a score a and then it actually gives us a score a quality score look at this 85 quality quality score look at this 85 quality quality score look at this 85 quality score that's very very high so to be score that's very very high so to be score that's very very high so to be clear this thing just took my notes it clear this thing just took my notes it clear this thing just took my notes it wrote an essay and it rated it very high wrote an essay and it rated it very high wrote an essay and it rated it very high and I have tuned this thing for a very and I have tuned this thing for a very and I have tuned this thing for a very long time so it's pretty hard to long time so it's pretty hard to long time so it's pretty hard to actually get an 85 so I'm impressed that actually get an 85 so I'm impressed that actually get an 85 so I'm impressed that it actually wrote an essay that scores it actually wrote an essay that scores it actually wrote an essay that scores that High um hopefully I would like to that High um hopefully I would like to that High um hopefully I would like to think that it was because the ideas and think that it was because the ideas and think that it was because the ideas and the notes were actually rated that high the notes were actually rated that high the notes were actually rated that high okay let's actually do something okay let's actually do something okay let's actually do something different I didn't plan on doing this different I didn't plan on doing this different I didn't plan on doing this let's actually just take the content of let's actually just take the content of let's actually just take the content of the note itself so I take this and I'm the note itself so I take

about the fabric project but in general about the fabric project but in general about the fabric project but in general my approach to AI is to take and magnify my approach to AI is to take and magnify my approach to AI is to take and magnify the human elements of of what we're the human elements of of what we're the human elements of of what we're doing in life right we have human doing in life right we have human doing in life right we have human problem problems let's solve it with AI problem problems let's solve it with AI problem problems let's solve it with AI we have human things that we enjoy let's we have human things that we enjoy let's we have human things that we enjoy let's enhance them with AI right let's not enhance them with AI right let's not enhance them with AI right let's not think about how to replace things let's think about how to replace things let's think about how to replace things let's focus human first supported by Tech focus human first supported by Tech focus human first supported by Tech supported by Ai and that's the way we supported by Ai and that's the way we supported by Ai and that's the way we think about it okay I want to talk real think about it okay I want to talk real think about it okay I want to talk real quick about how to install fabric it's quick about how to install fabric it's quick about how to install fabric it's pretty simple you go to the quick start pretty simple you go to the quick start pretty simple you go to the quick start link which is right here you download link which is right here you download link which is right here you download the the the installer uh basically the repo you installer uh basically the repo you installer uh basically the repo you download the repo go inside the repo you download the repo go inside the repo you download the repo go inside the repo you install poetry with this curl command install poetry with this curl command install poetry with this curl command you make your setup file executable you you make your setup file executable you you make your setup file executable you run the setup it basically installs all run the setup it basically installs all run the setup it basically installs all the dependencies and everything for you the dependencies and everything for you the dependencies and everything for you then you run fabric setup and that then you run fabric setup and that then you run fabric setup and that installs your key from open aai and then installs your key from open aai and then installs your key from open aai and then you can run fabric help and you will see you can run fabric help and you will see you can run fabric help and you will see this help menu here and then you are this help menu here and then you are this help menu here and then you are fully fully fully installed all right that was a quick installed all right that was a quick installed all right that was a quick overview of fabric and we are really overview of fabric and we are really overview of fabric and we are really excited about it we are really excited excited about it we are really excited excited about it we are really excited to have people go and play with it to have people go and play with it to have people go and play with it download it install it play with the download it install it play with the download it install it play with the patterns upload their own patterns can't patterns upload their own patterns can't patterns upload their own patterns can't wait to see what you do with it and uh I wait to see what you do with it and uh I wait to see what you do with it and uh I hope this philosophy does rub off on hope this philosophy does rub off on hope this philosophy does rub off on people that basically AI should not be people that basically AI should not be people that basically AI should not be considered a replacement for Humanity it considered a replacement for Humanity it considered a replacement for Humanity it is an augmentation it is an enhancement is an augmentation it is an enhancement is an augmentation it is an enhancement it is something that makes Humanity it is something that makes Humanity it is something that makes Humanity better and a lot of people won't see it better and a lot of people won't see it better and a lot of people won't see it that way and they'll take it in another that way and they'll take it in another that way and they'll take it in another Direction but we don't have to accept Direction but we don't have to accept Direction but we don't have to accept that and so our approach here with that and so our approach here with that and so our approach here with fabric is to very much think human first fabric is to very much think human first fabric is to very much think human first and we encourage you to do the same and and we encourage you to do the same and and we encourage you to do the same and we can't wait to see what you do with we can't wait to see what you do with we can't wait to see what you do with the project so thanks for listening and the project so thanks for listening and the project so thanks for listening and uh there'll be a lot more videos coming uh there'll be a lot more videos coming uh there'll be a lot more videos coming out soon with more and more use cases out soon with more and more use cases out soon with more and more use cases more and more patterns and we'll see you more and more patterns and we'll see you more and more patterns and we'll see you in the next one take care
