all right welcome to ins supervised all right welcome to ins supervised all right welcome to ins supervised learning this is Daniel misler and this learning this is Daniel misler and this learning this is Daniel misler and this is a big is a big is a big episode I've been wanting to do this for episode I've been wanting to do this for episode I've been wanting to do this for a number of months now and I finally got a number of months now and I finally got a number of months now and I finally got all the pieces together to be able to do all the pieces together to be able to do all the pieces together to be able to do it so let's jump in okay so this is a it so let's jump in okay so this is a it so let's jump in okay so this is a post called how my projects fit together post called how my projects fit together post called how my projects fit together it is a follow-up to a previous post it is a follow-up to a previous post it is a follow-up to a previous post called what I'm doing and how it's going called what I'm doing and how it's going called what I'm doing and how it's going and I think that came out about a year and I think that came out about a year and I think that came out about a year ago something like that but what this ago something like that but what this ago something like that but what this post does is it essentially answers the post does is it essentially answers the post does is it essentially answers the question that I get asked most often question that I get asked most often question that I get asked most often which is people looking at the various is people looking at the various is people looking at the various projects that I put out over the last projects that I put out over the last projects that I put out over the last year and basically saying look I I see year and basically saying look I I see year and basically saying look I I see you doing fabric I see you doing you doing fabric I see you doing you doing fabric I see you doing substrate and you keep talking about substrate and you keep talking about substrate and you keep talking about this thing called human 3.0 what exactly this thing called human 3.0 what exactly this thing called human 3.0 what exactly is all of this like what what are all is all of this like what what are all is all of this like what what are all these different projects how do they fit these different projects how do they fit these different projects how do they fit together are they all related what is together are they all related what is together are they all related what is going on and the answer is yes they are going on and the answer is yes they are going on and the answer is yes they are all related and I'm going to talk about all related and I'm going to talk about all related and I'm going to talk about how in this how in this how in this post okay so I like to start everything post okay so I like to start everything post okay so I like to start everything with a problem right I don't like to with a problem right I don't like to with a problem right I don't like to talk about Solutions which all of these talk about Solutions which all of these talk about Solutions which all of these are solutions to something right all of are solutions to something right all of are solutions to something right all of these different projects here they're these different projects here they're these different projects here they're all solutions to something and uh I all solutions to something and uh I all solutions to something and uh I don't like to jump immediately into don't like to jump immediately into don't like to jump immediately into talking about the solutions I'd rather talking about the solutions I'd rather talking about the solutions I'd rather talk about the problem that we're trying talk about the problem that we're trying talk about the problem that we're trying to solve first so these are roughly the to solve first so these are roughly the to solve first so these are roughly the major problems that I'm trying to solve major problems that I'm trying to solve major problems that I'm trying to solve currently with all my different work so currently with all my different work so currently with all my different work so uh WP stands for world uh WP stands for world uh WP stands for world problem and uh wp1 is humans are problem and uh wp1 is humans are problem and uh wp1 is humans are suffering from a lack of purpose and suffering from a lack of purpose and suffering from a lack of purpose and meaning in their lives which is causing meaning in their lives which is causing meaning in their lives which is causing mental health and societal mental health and societal mental health and societal problems so lack of meaning I would say problems so lack of meaning I would say problems so lack of meaning I would say if we had to make this if we had to make this if we had to make this um three words lack of purpose or lack um three words lack of purpose or lack um three words lack of purpose or lack of meaning I would say is number one of meaning I would say is number one of meaning I would say is number one okay second one humans do not understand okay second one humans do not understand okay second one humans do not understand and are not prepared for the and are not prepared for the and are not prepared for the sophistication and speed of introduction sophistication and speed of introduction sophistication and speed of introduction of AI into our society which will cause of AI into our society which will cause of AI into our society which will cause major work disruptions and exacerbate major work disruptions and exacerbate major work disruptions and exacerbate our lack of purpose so this is our lack of purpose so this is our lack of purpose so this is essentially the introduction of AI essentially the introduction of AI essentially the introduction of AI exacerbating the problem of number one exacerbating the problem of number one exacerbating the problem of number one okay so number one is a lack of purpose okay so number one is a lack of purpose okay so number one is a lack of purpose or meaning number two is AI is going to or meaning number two is AI is going to or meaning number two is AI is going to make it way make it way make it way worse and number three is humans are not worse and number three is humans are not worse and number three is humans are not trained to become full spectrum people trained to become full spectrum people trained to become full spectrum people but rather to become economically but rather to become economically but rather to become economically useful to a materialistic and useful to a materialistic and useful to a materialistic and transactional transactional transactional economy okay so this one's a little bit economy okay so this one's a little bit economy okay so this one's a little bit different very related though all three different very related though all three different very related though all three of these are related so essentially my of these are related so essentially my of these are related so essentially my work is centered mostly around solving work is centered mostly around solving work is centered mostly around solving those issues right now and I actually those issues right now and I actually those issues right now and I actually have multiple other problems to find have multiple other problems to find have multiple other problems to find which uh in my ts file I also have which uh in my ts file I also have which uh in my ts file I also have associated with other strategies and associated with other strategies and associated with other strategies and solutions and projects and stuff like solutions and projects and stuff like solutions and projects and stuff like that but these are the core these are that but these are the core these are that but these are the core these are the top the top the top three so next thing to say is that I am three so next thing to say is that I am three so next thing to say is that I am a security person I've always been a a security person I've always been a a security person I've always been a security person since the mid to late security person since the mid to late security person since the mid to late 90s and uh I always will be so I am 90s and uh I always will be so I am 90s and uh I always will be so I am going to continue doing security work I going to continue doing security work I going to continue doing security work I I think about everything in terms of I think about everything in terms of I think about everything in terms of security like it's just part of my DNA I security like it's just part of my DNA I security like it's just part of my DNA I can't unsee it every time I see any can't unsee it every time I see any can't unsee it every time I see any system I think about how transparent it system I think about how transparent it system I think about how transparent it is I think about ways to fix it break it is I think about ways to fix it break it is I think about ways to fix it break it um I'm always red teaming everything um I'm always red teaming everything um I'm always red teaming everything right so another way to think about this right so another way to think about this right so another way to think about this is that I view AI as containing security is that I view AI as containing security is that I view AI as containing security right I I feel like it contains security right I I feel like it contains security right I I feel like it contains security because if you think about it security because if you think about it security because if you think about it security is actually is actually is actually this is one of my favorite things about this is one of my favorite things about this is one of my favorite things about security is that uh it's security is that uh it's security is that uh it's Latin and it means SE which is without Latin and it means SE which is without Latin and it means SE which is without and Kura which is worry so without worry and Kura which is worry so without worry and Kura which is worry so without worry and if you think about the problems here and if you think about the problems here and if you think about the problems here I am worried about these I believe I am worried about these I believe I am worried about these I believe humans uh consciously or unconsciously humans uh consciously or unconsciously humans uh consciously or unconsciously are worried about these things so I'm are worried about these things so I'm are worried about these things so I'm trying to remove the worry from these trying to remove the worry from these trying to remove the worry from these things so people can go on and be things so people can go on and be things so people can go on and be extremely productive and have meaning extremely productive and have meaning extremely productive and have meaning meaningful lives right so ultimately meaningful lives right so ultimately meaningful lives right so ultimately this is all kind of the same thing it's this is all kind of the same thing it's this is all kind of the same thing it's all kind of a giving people security so all kind of a giving people security so all kind of a giving people security so that they can Thrive I mean that's that they can Thrive I mean that's that they can Thrive I mean that's that's ultimately what this is all that's ultimately what this is all that's ultimately what this is all about about about now um there are two main ways that I'm now um there are two main ways that I'm now um there are two main ways that I'm basically pursuing this uh continuing to basically pursuing this uh continuing to basically pursuing this uh continuing to pursue this on the security side pursue this on the security side pursue this on the security side tangible ways like I'm going to do it tangible ways like I'm going to do it tangible ways like I'm going to do it all the time I'm still advising I'm all the time I'm still advising I'm all the time I'm still advising I'm still Consulting I'm still doing still Consulting I'm still doing still Consulting I'm still doing assessments but in terms of actual assessments but in terms of actual assessments but in terms of actual projects these are my two main projects projects these are my two main projects projects these are my two main projects that I still have going and I continue that I still have going and I continue that I still have going and I continue to upgrade as well so one is called to upgrade as well so one is called to upgrade as well so one is called Helios which is continuous attack Helios which is continuous attack Helios which is continuous attack surface monitoring which I'm um now surface monitoring which I'm um now surface monitoring which I'm um now starting to add AI stuff to as well but starting to add AI stuff to as well but starting to add AI stuff to as well but essentially I've been running this for essentially I've been running this for essentially I've been running this for years and years I still have paying years and years I still have paying years and years I still have paying customers on it and uh I I just love customers on it and uh I I just love customers on it and uh I I just love attack surface management I love attack surface management I love attack surface management I love automatically quickly discovering automatically quickly discovering automatically quickly discovering vulnerabilities and then being able to vulnerabilities and then being able to vulnerabilities and then being able to find the weaknesses there um or or find the weaknesses there um or or find the weaknesses there um or or finding attack service and then being finding attack service and then being finding attack service and then being able to find the weaknesses in the able to find the weaknesses in the able to find the weaknesses in the attack surface and then going on to attack surface and then going on to attack surface and then going on to exploitation um and then reporting on exploitation um and then reporting on exploitation um and then reporting on that alerting very quickly that that's a that alerting very quickly that that's a that alerting very quickly that that's a thing that I just love um and I think it thing that I just love um and I think it thing that I just love um and I think it very much applies to like the world very much applies to like the world very much applies to like the world around me I basically want Helios for around me I basically want Helios for around me I basically want Helios for everything so that's like basically the everything so that's like basically the everything so that's like basically the platform that I'm building there but platform that I'm building there but platform that I'm building there but this one specifically is Just for this one specifically is Just for this one specifically is Just for information security attack service and information security attack service and information security attack service and it's an actual product that you know uh it's an actual product that you know uh it's an actual product that you know uh customers can actually send up for uh customers can actually send up for uh customers can actually send up for uh this next one is called domain and this this next one is called domain and this this next one is called domain and this one is relatively new it's basically one is relatively new it's basically one is relatively new it's basically security program management using the TS security program management using the TS security program management using the TS infrastructure which I'm going to talk infrastructure which I'm going to talk infrastructure which I'm going to talk about later and this is an actual about later and this is an actual about later and this is an actual project um and an actual product as well project um and an actual product as well project um and an actual product as well okay so those are the two main security okay so those are the two main security okay so those are the two main security projects that I'm going to be focused on projects that I'm going to be focused on projects that I'm going to be focused on and will continue to be focused on so and will continue to be focused on so and will continue to be focused on so now let's get into the main core ones uh now let's get into the main core ones uh now let's get into the main core ones uh that are more closely tied to the that are more closely tied to the that are more closely tied to the problems that we just talked about so problems that we just talked about so problems that we just talked about so the projects are substrate fabric TS the projects are substrate fabric TS the projects are substrate fabric TS Damon and hum 3.0 which is kind of the Damon and hum 3.0 which is kind of the Damon and hum 3.0 which is kind of the centerpiece for all of these so we're centerpiece for all of these so we're centerpiece for all of these so we're going to look at each one individually going to look at each one individually going to look at each one individually first and then how they work first and then how they work first and then how they work together so I have a full explainer together so I have a full explainer together so I have a full explainer video here uh on substrate which uh we video here uh on substrate which uh we video here uh on substrate which uh we we'll put a link to there at the top and we'll put a link to there at the top and we'll put a link to there at the top and also this will all be in the description also this will all be in the description also this will all be in the description for the video but uh substrate has its for the video but uh substrate has its for the video but uh substrate has its own video it's got its own full Blog own video it's got its own full Blog own video it's got its own full Blog Page and everything full description but Page and everything full description but Page and everything full description but it is an open- Source framework for it is an open- Source framework for it is an open- Source framework for increasing human understanding meaning increasing human understanding meaning increasing human understanding meaning and progress so it's basically designed and progress so it's basically designed and progress so it's basically designed to make things that matter to humans to make things that matter to humans to make things that matter to humans more transparent discussible and more transparent discussible and more transparent discussible and ultimately ultimately ultimately fixable um and I've got an example here fixable um and I've got an example here fixable um and I've got an example here that I that I put in just to um remind that I that I put in just to um remind that I that I put in just to um remind you from the actual page so it's you from the actual page so it's you from the actual page so it's basically a map to explain things and basically a map to explain things and basically a map to explain things and solve problems solve problems solve problems and it's so big that it it's kind of and it's so big that it it's kind of and it's so big that it it's kind of abstract so it's better to use an abstract so it's better to use an abstract so it's better to use an example so here's an example of an example so here's an example of an example so here's an example of an argument component in fact I'm going to argument component in fact I'm going to argument component in fact I'm going to pull up an actual argument component pull up an actual argument component pull up an actual argument component which I submitted uh which is even which I submitted uh which is even which I submitted uh which is even better but think of an argument you better but think of an argument you better but think of an argument you might hear on any given day about might hear on any given day about might hear on any given day about whatever topic right so I don't know why whatever topic right so I don't know why whatever topic right so I don't know why you recycle it's a total waste it cost you recycle it's a total waste it cost you recycle it's a total waste it cost so much to recycle you know the programs so much to recycle you know the programs so much to recycle you know the programs are poorly run or whatever so this is an are poorly run or whatever so this is an are poorly run or whatever so this is an argument that you would hear in normal argument that you would hear in normal argument that you would hear in normal life right so what I'm trying to do is life right so what I'm trying to do is life right so what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to make it easier for humans I'm trying to make it easier for humans I'm trying to make it easier for humans to communicate with each other using to communicate with each other using to communicate with each other using tangible transparent things not just tangible transparent things not just tangible transparent things not just throwing out random claims which are throwing out random claims which are throwing out random claims which are opaque and you can't possibly research opaque and you can't possibly research opaque and you can't possibly research them and it's just a whole bunch of like them and it's just a whole bunch of like them and it's just a whole bunch of like mini claims inside of one big claim and mini claims inside of one big claim and mini claims inside of one big claim and then you basically have just rhetoric then you basically have just rhetoric then you basically have just rhetoric being shot you know between two people being shot you know between two people being shot you know between two people and it's just a total waste so we're and it's just a total waste so we're and it's just a total waste so we're confronted by this type of thing confronted by this type of thing confronted by this type of thing constantly uh about recycling but things constantly uh about recycling but things constantly uh about recycling but things that matter a lot more than that you that matter a lot more than that you that matter a lot more than that you know other type of political things but know other type of political things but know other type of political things but what subst

understanding I've got a claim here which is uh what that is argument here which is uh what that is argument here which is uh what that is argument style it's a deductive argument which style it's a deductive argument which style it's a deductive argument which means building claims that lead to a means building claims that lead to a means building claims that lead to a conclusion and if you want to disagree conclusion and if you want to disagree conclusion and if you want to disagree with a conclusion you have to find a with a conclusion you have to find a with a conclusion you have to find a problem with the previous statements problem with the previous statements problem with the previous statements right and then I've got a series of right and then I've got a series of right and then I've got a series of statements that result in the conclusion statements that result in the conclusion statements that result in the conclusion which is number eight therefore AIS are which is number

Humanity it doesn't have to be everything okay you put what you want in everything okay you put what you want in everything okay you put what you want in your demon and you can even have it your demon and you can even have it your demon and you can even have it blocked off and everything like the the blocked off and everything like the the blocked off and everything like the the better the tech gets the more you're better the tech gets the more you're better the tech gets the more you're going to need authentication to get to going to need authentication to get to going to need authentication to get to certain ones and only friends can see it certain ones and only friends can see it certain ones and only friends can see it like all that will come but essentially like all that will come but essentially like all that will come but essentially what this is starting what this is starting what this is starting with is a structure for defining your with is a structure for defining your with is a structure for defining your personal API okay so that's what it's personal API okay so that's what it's personal API okay so that's what it's going to be it's a schema and going to be it's a schema and going to be it's a schema and essentially what I'm doing here and this essentially what I'm doing here and this essentially what I'm doing here and this is pretty early on for this one what I'm is pretty early on for this one what I'm is pretty early on for this one what I'm going to do here is I'm going to have going to do here is I'm going to have going to do here is I'm going to have the schema I'm have the ab uh templates the schema I'm have the ab uh templates the schema I'm have the ab uh templates for the schema for people to fill in I'm for the schema for people to fill in I'm for the schema for people to fill in I'm also going to have um collectors that go also going to have um collectors that go also going to have um collectors that go and get and get and get it from your content if you want to run it from your content if you want to run it from your content if you want to run that you just run it yourself it goes that you just run it yourself it goes that you just run it yourself it goes and collects all your different stuff and collects all your different stuff and collects all your different stuff and then it puts it in there and then of and then it puts it in there and then of and then it puts it in there and then of course you can edit it and then I'm course you can edit it and then I'm course you can edit it and then I'm going to have like a Docker container going to have like a Docker container going to have like a Docker container I'm going to have like a domain setup or I'm going to have like a domain setup or I'm going to have like a domain setup or something like that where it all something like that where it all something like that where it all connects together and you press go and connects together and you press go and connects together and you press go and broom it spins up and on a particular broom it spins up and on a particular broom it spins up and on a particular domain that is associated with domain that is associated with domain that is associated with you you will now be broadcasting your you you will now be broadcasting your you you will now be broadcasting your Damon and then as people start to spin Damon and then as people start to spin Damon and then as people start to spin up their up their up their Das and when people meet each other so Das and when people meet each other so Das and when people meet each other so for example you could have like on your for example you could have like on your for example you could have like on your necklace thing or in a in a Damon necklace thing or in a in a Damon necklace thing or in a in a Damon broadcast that is actually local or on a broadcast that is actually local or on a broadcast that is actually local or on a arm patch that is a QR code those can arm patch that is a QR code those can arm patch that is a QR code those can all be URLs to your actual Damon so when all be URLs to your actual Damon so when all be URLs to your actual Damon so when your personal um Tech that you're your personal um Tech that you're your personal um Tech that you're walking with has a camera on it which is walking with has a camera on it which is walking

soon I mean metag glasses already do but soon I mean metag glasses already do but I'm talking about a continuous camera I'm talking about a continuous camera I'm talking about a continuous camera when it sees somebody's QR code walking when it sees somebody's QR code walking when it sees somebody's QR code walking by broom it pulls the thing assuming by broom it pulls the thing assuming by broom it pulls the thing assuming it's not already broadcasting and can't it's not already broadcasting and can't it's not already broadcasting and can't detect it in a different way the point detect it in a

talk about okay all right so now let's talk about okay all right so now let's talk about the the core philosophy here of human the the core philosophy here of human the the core philosophy here of

this has nothing to do the future is this has nothing to do with a platform it has nothing to do with a platform it has nothing to do with a platform it has nothing to do with tech I believe this is a changing with tech I believe this is a changing with tech I believe this is a changing of old to new from Legacy to what is of old to new from Legacy to what is of old to new from Legacy to what is coming and importantly I think there's a coming and importantly I think there's a coming and importantly I think there's a chasm in between these two things okay chasm in between these two things okay chasm in between these two things okay I'm worry that we're being hit with I'm worry that we're being hit with I'm worry that we're being hit with AI and it's about to AI and it's about to AI and it's about to wreck hundreds of millions no billions wreck hundreds of millions no billions wreck hundreds of millions no billions of people it's about to wreck billions of people it's about to wreck

is social media you got tech tech is social media you got tech tech is causing more problems um But ultimately causing more problems um But ultimately causing more problems um But ultimately it comes down to we lost community and it comes down to we lost community and it comes down to we lost community and we lost we lost we lost religion and uh it it was just taking us religion and uh it it was just taking us religion and uh it it was just taking us in a bad place now bring AI in and one in a bad place now bring AI in and one in a bad place now bring AI in and one of the core things that gives us meaning of the core things that gives us meaning of the core things that gives us meaning as humans is actually our work the fact as humans is actually our work the fact as humans is actually our work the fact that we feel like we're making some sort that we feel like we're making some sort that we feel like we're making some sort of contribution to work somebody of contribution to work somebody of contribution to work somebody appreciates what we're doing we're appreciates what we're doing we're appreciates what we're doing we're obviously having some sort of positive obviously

platform that I am the second piece is a platform that I am the second piece is a platform that I am building an actual platform a tech building an actual platform a tech building an actual platform a tech platform that helps platform that helps platform that helps you figure out what human 3.0 is and it you figure out what human 3.0 is and it you figure out what human 3.0 is and it takes you through a giant series of takes you through a giant series of takes you through a giant series of steps it's a guided walk through of steps it's a guided walk through of steps it's a guided walk through of steps in a curated you know organized steps in a curated you know organized steps in a curated you know organized way so it's a full set of video courses way so it's a full set of video courses way so it's a full set of video courses like I haven't built all this stuff yet like I haven't built all this stuff yet like I haven't built all this stuff yet um fully um I'm I'm still working on the um fully um I'm I'm still working on the um fully um I'm I'm still working on the curriculum but it's essentially a curriculum but it's essentially a curriculum but it's essentially a curriculum it's videos it's all this curriculum it's videos it's all this curriculum it's videos it's all this different stuff uh this is not the pitch different stuff uh this is not the pitch different stuff uh this is not the pitch for that so I'm not going to go into for that so I'm not going to go into for that so I'm not going to go into that here but it shows you like how to that here but it shows you like how to that here but it shows you like how to use teos how to build your TS file use teos how to build your TS file use teos how to build your TS file yourself um how to use fabric to look at yourself um how to use fabric to look at yourself um how to use fabric to look at your TS file how to build your Damon your TS file how to build your Damon your TS file how to build your Damon it's like basically a walk through of it's like basically a walk through of it's like basically a walk through of how to actually go and Implement all how to actually go and Implement all how to actually go and Implement all this other stuff but here's the point this other stuff but here's the point this other stuff but here's the point you don't actually need this thing that you don't actually need this thing that you don't actually need this thing that I'm building okay you don't need I'm building okay you don't need I'm building okay you don't need it all you have to do is look at all the it all you have to do is look at all the it all you have to do is look at all the other projects which are the core other projects which are the core other projects which are the core projects you can actually just go get projects you can actually just go get projects you can actually just go get them use them the way I talk about in them use them the way I talk about in them use them the way I talk about in the the the videos and you're already doing it videos and you're already doing it videos and you're already doing it you're already moving towards uh human 3 you're already moving towards uh human 3 you're already moving towards uh human 3 .0 and I'm going to make the assessment .0 and I'm going to make the assessment .0 and I'm going to make the assessment like the assessment is going to be like the assessment is going to be like the assessment is going to be available also open source so it's like available also open source so it's like available also open source so it's like you could do all this stuff without the you could do all this stuff without the you could do all this stuff without the platform 100% like that's the way it's platform 100% like that's the way it's platform 100% like that's the way it's designed um but some people they want to designed um but some people they want to designed um but some people they want to be walked through it they wanted to be be walked through it they wanted to be be walked through it they wanted to be walk through it in an organized way and walk through it in an organized way and walk through it in an organized way and that's why I'm building the human 3.0 that's why I'm building the human 3.0 that's why I'm building the human 3.0 platform which is called platform which is called platform which is called H3 so yeah all the different stuff shows H3 so yeah all the different stuff shows H3 so yeah all the different stuff shows you how to build online presence shows you how to build online
